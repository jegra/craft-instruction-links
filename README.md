## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-beta.23 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

## Using Craft Instruction Links

Use Markdown links in your field's Instructions. Watch in delight as the link actually opens in a new tab
rather than making you lose your work.
